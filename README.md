### **Project Title: Vrinda Store Sales Analysis Using Microsoft Excel**

The **Vrinda Store Sales Analysis project** focuses on understanding and optimizing the sales performance of a fictional retail store named *Vrinda Store*. Using the versatile features of **Microsoft Excel**, this project transforms raw sales data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to support business decision-making by identifying top-performing products, tracking sales trends, evaluating customer behavior, and understanding key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and inventory movement.
